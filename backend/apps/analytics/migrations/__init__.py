# backend/apps/analytics/migrations/__init__.py
"""
Migrations package for the `analytics` app.

This module intentionally kept minimal — its presence makes the `migrations`
package importable so Django's migration system can discover migration files
(e.g. 0001_initial.py) placed here.

Do not add application logic here. Keep all migration code inside separate
migration files created by `python manage.py makemigrations` / `migrate`.
