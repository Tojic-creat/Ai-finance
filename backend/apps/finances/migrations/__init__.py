"""
Migrations package for the `finances` app.

This file intentionally left minimal — presence of this module makes the
`migrations` package importable so Django's migration machinery can discover
and load migration modules (e.g. 0001_initial.py) placed here.

Do not put application logic here. Keep migrations in separate files created by
`python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
