# backend/apps/notifications/migrations/__init__.py
"""
Migrations package for the `notifications` app.

This file intentionally remains minimal — it makes the `migrations` package
importable so Django's migration system can discover migration files
(e.g. 0001_initial.py) placed here.

Do not add application logic in this file. Keep migration code inside
separate migration files created by `manage.py makemigrations`.
